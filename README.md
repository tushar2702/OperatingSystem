# pintos

Completed a series of projects based on PintOS operating system (see: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html)

1) Implemented Threads in PintOS
Given a minimally functional thread system in PintOS, extended the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems. Implemented Priority scheduling and priority donation for thread system in PintOS.

2) Implemented User Programs in PintOS
Given a functional program loader in PintOS, designed and implemented a complete system call API to run user processes with synchronization primitives in PintOS kernel. Updated PintOS kernel code to interact with user programs using core I/O system calls.

3) Implemented Virtual Memory in PintOS
Extended the virtual memory system in PintOS to run user processes - support paging to/from disk, dynamic stack growth, and memory mapped files. Implemented the mmap and munmap system calls, swap table structure.

4) Implemented File Systems in PintOS
Given a functional file system implementation in PintOS, extended the file system to support variable length files via fragmentation, a directory hierarchy, and a buffer cache to improve disk access times. Handled synchronization issues, as files and directories can be read and written by multiple programs at the same time.
